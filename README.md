## üß© Fundamentals

### 1. Variables and Scoping

Variables in programming are fundamental for storing data, and their scope determines accessibility within various parts of the program.

- **Example in Node.js**: In the [Node Movie API](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/node-movie-api) project, local variables declared with `let` or `const` within routes (e.g., `routes/movies.js`) are accessible only within that function scope, preventing unintended access.
- **Example in C++**: In the [Terminal Fire Animation](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/scheumine--terminal-fire-animation), project, variables like `width` and `height` are defined within the `main` function, ensuring they are scoped locally and not accessible outside this function, which helps in maintaining encapsulation and preventing unintended side effects.

### 2. Typing Systems (Static/Dynamic)

Typing systems define when and how variable types are checked.

- **Node.js (Dynamic Typing)**: JavaScript‚Äôs typing is dynamic, so variables can change types at runtime. For example, in the Node Movie API project, `let genre = 'Action';` could later be reassigned to a number if needed.
- **C++ (Static Typing)**: C++ is statically typed, meaning variable types are determined at compile-time. In the [Terminal Fire Animation](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/scheumine--terminal-fire-animation) project, variables such as `int width` and `int height` have their types explicitly declared, ensuring type safety and preventing type-related errors during compilation.

### 3. Type Inference

Type inference allows the compiler or interpreter to deduce variable types automatically.

- **C++**: While C++ is statically typed, it supports type inference through the `auto` keyword. In the [Terminal Fire Animation](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/scheumine--terminal-fire-animation) project, using auto can simplify code by allowing the compiler to infer the type of a variable from its initializer, reducing verbosity and potential errors.

## üèõÔ∏è Object-Oriented Programming

### 1. Classes and Objects

Classes and objects are the core building blocks of OOP. Classes define data structure and behavior, while objects are instances of these classes.

#### Examples
- **C++ Mongoose Library**: In the [cpp-mongoose](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/cpp-mongoose) project, the `MongoSchema` class encapsulates the schema definition and operations for MongoDB collections. It manages CRUD operations, data validation, and index creation, providing a structured approach to interact with the database.
- **Enigma Machine Simulation**: The [Enigma-cpp](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/Enigma-cpp) project includes classes such as `Rotor`, `Reflector`, and `EnigmaMachine`. Each class represents a component of the Enigma machine, encapsulating specific behaviors and data, and working together to simulate the encryption and decryption processes.

### 2. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes.

#### 1. Single and Multiple Inheritance
   - **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from a single parent class, extending its functionality.
   - **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from multiple parent classes, which is supported in C++ but can introduce complexity due to the "diamond problem."

#### Examples
- **Enigma Machine Simulation**: While the current implementation focuses on composition, an example of single inheritance could involve creating a base class `MachineComponent` with common attributes and methods, and then deriving `Rotor` and `Reflector` classes from it. This would allow shared functionality to be defined in the base class and specialized behaviors in the derived classes.
- **C++ Mongoose Library**: The [cpp-mongoose](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/cpp-mongoose) project is structured as a library with a base class `MongoSchema` that can be extended to define specific schemas. By inheriting from `MongoSchema`, users can create specialized schemas and override the `initializeSchema` and `validation` methods to tailor the schema to their needs.

   For example, let's say you want to create a `UserSchema` to manage user-related data. By inheriting from `MongoSchema`, you can create this specialized schema as follows:

   ```cpp
   #include "MongoSchema.h"

   class UserSchema : public MongoSchema {
   public:
       UserSchema() : MongoSchema("users") {
           // Custom constructor logic if needed
       }

   protected:
       // Initialize schema-specific configuration, like indexes or default values
       void initializeSchema(bsoncxx::document::view document) override {
           // Logic to initialize document-specific schema configurations
           // This could involve setting default values, creating additional fields, etc.
       }

       // Define validation logic specific to "User"
       bool validation() const override {
           // Define validation logic for User schema
           return true;  // Replace with actual validation checks
       }
   };
   ```
  In this example:
  
  *   `UserSchema` inherits from `MongoSchema`, passing `"users"` as the collection name.
  *   `initializeSchema` is overridden to allow schema-specific initialization, such as setting default values or custom configuration.
  *   `validation` is overridden to define validation rules specific to the `UserSchema`.

#### 2. Interface Inheritance and Abstract Classes

- **Abstract Classes**: These are classes that cannot be instantiated directly and are intended to be extended. They often contain pure virtual functions, providing a template for derived classes to implement specific behaviors.
- **Interface Inheritance**: In C++, abstract classes can serve as interfaces when they include only pure virtual methods. 

**Examples**
- **Enigma Machine Simulation**: In this project, an abstract class like `Encryptable` could represent an interface with methods for encryption and decryption. `Rotor` and `Reflector` classes could implement this interface, ensuring that all components in the machine follow a consistent interface for encryption.
- **C++ Mongoose Library**: In the **cpp-mongoose** project, `MongoSchema` acts as a base class with virtual methods like `initializeSchema` and `validation` that derived classes can override. This enables each schema, such as a hypothetical `UserSchema`, to define its specific initialization and validation rules, providing flexibility for various database models.

##### 3. Prototype-Based vs. Class-Based Inheritance

- **Class-Based Inheritance**: C++ uses class-based inheritance, with hierarchies defined explicitly in class relationships. 
- **Prototype-Based Inheritance**: While C++ doesn‚Äôt use prototype-based inheritance, you can use patterns like object cloning or factory functions to create reusable and dynamic object types.

**Examples**
- **Enigma Machine Simulation**: The project is inherently class-based, with `EnigmaMachine` composed of different components, such as `Rotor` and `Reflector`. This modular design allows specific machine configurations.
- **C++ Mongoose Library**: The class-based structure in `MongoSchema` allows for explicit inheritance, enabling new schemas to build upon and customize the generic database handling capabilities offered by the library.

#### 3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows for accessing different types through a common interface, enabling behaviors to vary depending on the object type at runtime.

##### Dynamic Dispatch and Late Binding
- **Dynamic Dispatch**: C++ uses virtual functions to achieve dynamic dispatch, where the function called on an object is determined at runtime.
- **Late Binding**: C++ virtual functions also implement late binding, where method implementation details are resolved at runtime.

**Examples**
- **Enigma Machine Simulation**: Polymorphism could be applied here by defining a base class `MachineComponent` with a virtual method like `processSignal`. Derived classes like `Rotor` and `Reflector` would override this method, allowing `EnigmaMachine` to process each component polymorphically based on its type.
- **C++ Mongoose Library**: The `MongoSchema` base class in **cpp-mongoose** includes virtual functions such as `validation` and `initializeSchema`. Derived classes can override these methods to customize their behavior, enabling polymorphic behavior for different schema types while ensuring a consistent API for MongoDB interactions.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Functional Programming 

The [`cli-slot-game`](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/cli-slot-game) repository demonstrates several functional programming concepts in C++.

### Pure Functions and Referential Transparency

Pure functions are those that, given the same input, always produce the same output without causing any side effects. In the [`cli-slot-game`](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/cli-slot-game), functions responsible for generating the slot machine's symbols and determining the outcome of a spin are designed to be pure. They rely solely on their input parameters and do not modify any external state, ensuring consistent behavior and referential transparency.

### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. In this project, the use of higher-order functions is evident in the implementation of the game's mechanics. For instance, functions that handle the animation of the slot reels may accept other functions as parameters to customize the behavior of the animation, such as the speed or pattern of the spin. This approach enhances the modularity and reusability of the code.

By adhering to functional programming principles, the [`cli-slot-game`](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/cli-slot-game) achieves a clean and maintainable codebase, facilitating easier testing and debugging.

## üöÄ Advanced Topics

### 1. Reflection

Reflection enables a program to inspect and manipulate objects, methods, and properties at runtime. This feature is commonly used for tasks such as dynamic type checking, method invocation, and property access in languages with runtime type information. In C++, reflection is not built-in as it is in some other languages, but certain workarounds and libraries (such as `typeid`, RTTI, and `std::type_info`) can offer basic reflection capabilities.

**Examples**

- **C++ Mongoose Library**: In the [cpp-mongoose](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/cpp-mongoose) project, type information can be extracted at runtime to handle different database schema configurations dynamically. Using `typeid` and `std::type_info`, the project can determine the specific type of schema being accessed, making the code adaptable to different MongoDB data structures.
  
- **Terminal Fire Animation**: In the [scheumine--terminal-fire-animation](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/scheumine--terminal-fire-animation) project, although it doesn‚Äôt use full reflection, runtime type checking could be useful for managing different display types or color effects. For instance, using `typeid` to check the types of display components might allow for customization based on terminal capabilities, improving adaptability without hardcoding all possible configurations.

### 2. Generics

Generics allow a class, function, or data structure to operate on different data types while providing compile-time type safety. They enhance code reusability and flexibility by allowing functions and classes to work with any data type. In C++, generics are implemented using templates.

**Examples**

- **Enigma Machine Simulation**: In the [Enigma-cpp](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/Enigma-cpp) project, templates can be used to define generic encryption or processing functions that accept various types of data or components. By using templates, this project can implement algorithms that work with different encryption components or even new components that might be added later, increasing flexibility and reusability.
  
- **CLI Slot Game**: The [cli-slot-game](https://github.com/ohalukkarakaya/cli-slot-game) project uses templates for handling various data types in game mechanics and rendering output. For example, using a template-based function to generate slot symbols allows the game to be adapted for different types of symbols without modifying core logic, enhancing modularity and reusability.
